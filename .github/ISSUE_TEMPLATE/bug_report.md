**Describe the bug**

During a post-game replay of the mission "Claustrophobia", I noticed how an APDS round shot from my M2 Bradley, which was aimed at a BMP1, collided with the inverted crew model of a exploded nearby turret of a dead T-55A; the round, having hit the (non)existent crew, spalled and lost energy, creating an unrealistic outcome

**Are you playing with mods?**

No, vanilla game

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Start mission "Claustrophobia" (altough it might be a more general bug)
2. Destroy a T-55A by making its turret explode AND land inverted
3. Shoot slightly above the base of the inverted turret
4. See bug


**Expected Behavior**

The round shouldn't collide with the crew, as the latter simply should not be there, therefore its trajectory should remain unchanged

**Sources**

Common sense (joke). On a more serious note, I didn't see or hear anyone have the same problem, so for now it's just me
